## 🚀 About Me
Machine Learning, Robotics, and Computer Vision engineer pursuing an MS in Electrical Engineering (AI & Autonomous Systems) at NUST. I build and validate 3D perception and SLAM systems across simulation and real-world platforms, with hands-on experience in dataset curation, multi-sensor fusion, and model prototyping using PyTorch and TensorFlow.

My work spans the full ML lifecycle — evaluation, monitoring, drift detection, and deployment to edge (Jetson, ESP32) and cloud — with an emphasis on production-grade QA and reproducible outputs for 3D reconstruction, measurement and damage-detection tasks. I translate research prototypes (VLMs, DQN, ORB-SLAM) into robust, testable systems, and enjoy mentoring students and collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver practical AI solutions.

## 🧑‍💻 Work Experience
- **Senior Quality Assurance Specialist — Computer Vision & 3D Perception @ Pointivo** (Feb 2024 – Present)  
  - Generated high-precision 3D geometric models and ground-truth wireframes from drone-captured point cloud data to validate the accuracy of automated reconstruction pipelines.
  - Produced high-fidelity digital twins for telecom infrastructure, performing rigorous data quality audits within an AI-driven platform to ensure spatial and structural reliability.
  - Identified recurring reconstruction and measurement failure modes through manual review and maintained structured QA records that helped teams recognize output degradation patterns over time.
  - Curated and annotated large-scale aerial imagery datasets, providing the essential labeled data required for training and refining computer vision models for automated damage detection.
  - Created a RAG-based chatbot and documentation assistant to accelerate QA triage and customer operations.

- **Assistant Engineer (Electronics) — Quality & Systems Testing @ Federal Government of Pakistan** (Aug 2022 – Feb 2024)  
  - Led data-driven verification and root-cause analysis for electronic control systems; implemented QMS improvements following ISO 9001:2015.  
  - Built repeatable test scripts and instrumentation workflows to measure and report system performance.

- **Quality Assurance Specialist (3D Mapping & Reconstruction) @ Pointivo** (Apr 2019 – Aug 2022)  
  - Produced annotated datasets and 3D wireframes from drone imagery for automated inspection and model training.  
  - Validated geometry and annotation quality; coordinated with ML/product teams to close dataset-to-model feedback loops.

- **Research Intern — Robotics & Sensor Integration, RISE Lab (NUST)** (Jun 2015 – Aug 2015)  
  - Prototype work on sensor fusion and multi-agent localization; validated sensing/control concepts on early robotic platforms.
